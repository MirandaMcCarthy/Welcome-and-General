# Welcome and General README

Hello, everyone! This is GitHub. I suggest you find out how to use this site because we will be using it to share our code. Check out some of the guides they provide for this website here: https://guides.github.com/. The "Hello World" guide is probably the most useful. 
Branches, commits, and pull requests are all core parts of GitHub, and you can read about them in the "Hello World" guide. "Understanding the GitHub Flow" also has some good clarifying information.

Please note that all major changes should be created under a branch. This will prevent us from accidentally ruining anything. Additionally, we can discuss the changes before they are implemented into the program.
 
You can view the code by going to https://github.com/WTMCRobotics. Although, you must be logged in to do anything.

This repository was just to let you know what is going on, and we can put general ideas, information, or resources about robotics here.
